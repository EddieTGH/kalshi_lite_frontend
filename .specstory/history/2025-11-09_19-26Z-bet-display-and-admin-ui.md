# Bet display and admin UI (2025-11-09 19:26Z)

_**User (2025-12-18 11:24Z)**_

1. Put pending bets that users have created in another scrollable independent expandable component (underneath resolved and unresolved) that says "your created pending bets" and lists them there. ONce they get approved, they get removed from this category.

2. Lets put the buttons directly in the betcard component for admin ui. (if its too cluttered tho, reconsider, maybe put the buttons just below the card in a horizontal row)

3. clock icon is good for pending status

4. status filter should default to approved

5. status filter dropdown siffucient for now

6. i think opening a modal dialog with the edit form is good
